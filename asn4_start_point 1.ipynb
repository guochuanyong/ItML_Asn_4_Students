        "<li> The dataset is imbalanced. See: https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/structured_data/imbalanced_data for some ideas\n",
        "<li> The locations, time, dob all likely aren't super useful on their own, but can be made into something more useful without much code or trouble. Think about how it may be useful to represent them. The data doesn't have missing rows, so this is the main data prep portion. \n",
        "<li> With respect to the above, and the other data here, we have a lot of rows of data. That means that we can generally handle data that is reasonably wide...\n",

        "    <li> Any data prep stuff that is needed for your data should be built in here. I'm going to run a test file that is the exact same setup as the training data.\n",
